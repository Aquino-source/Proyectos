# Shopping Cart API

A modular and lightweight API designed to manage a digital shopping cart. This project provides core functionality to handle item selection, storage, and CRUD operations, serving as a foundational piece for local business management systems.

## 🚀 Project Architecture

The API is structured into four main modules to ensure a clean separation of concerns:

* **`app.py`**: The entry point (Main). It initializes the server and defines the API endpoints and routes.
* **`crud.py`**: Contains the core business logic and functions for Creating, Reading, Updating, and Deleting items.
* **`shopping_cart.py`**: Manages the cart state and handles the temporary storage of items.
* **`requirements.txt`**: Lists all the necessary dependencies to run the project.
